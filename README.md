Hello This is a CRUD BLOG project.
The tech Stack Employed are HTML/CSS, JS, EJS for templating Frontend and Express+ Node at Backend to Handle the Request.
You can do CRUD Operation on this blog. CREATE, READ, UPDATE, DELETE Post.
Data Saved won't persist.
I will Continue to update the readme.

Some future Update will be:
Adding a TimeStamp for each post.
persisting data using postgre sql.
Adding a Proper Patch request.

There are also some logical issues in the project. Basically in the Patch request and the unique identifier i used for each post. that's a bug need some fixing.
